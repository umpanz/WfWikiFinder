Warframe WikiFinder
Pretty easy to use program to quickly open a page from ther Warframe Wiki.
First you're going to be asked for the item category, after that you're asked for the starting letter of your item, then you just have to choose your desired item from a numbered list et voil√†, wiki page opens.

Do you need it? Nah, probably not. 
Is it easy and fast to use while gaming? Yep.
